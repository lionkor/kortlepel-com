<h1>Hello, Visitor</h1>
<p>I'm Lion, a software developer from Germany.
    I write and review open source software in my free time.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://blog.kortlepel.com" target="_blank">blog</a>!</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Check out a summary of my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a> or in detail on my <a
        href="https://github.com/lionkor">GitHub</a>, and my <a href="https://gitlab.com/lionkor">GitLab</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I enjoy working in teams on large and small projects, or by myself. Not only that, but I get great joy from
    experimenting with low-level programming, performance optimization and ensuring high code quality.
</p>
<p>The most enjoyable part of programming for me is when I get to solve larger issues on both a design- and
    implementation level, and I have a lot of experience doing so.</p>
<p>A lot of my personal projects, however, revolve around "re-implementing the wheel"; developing a common technology
    from the ground up, in order to learn about the internals and challenges, and to grow my understanding of it.</p>
