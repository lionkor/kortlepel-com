Source code for my website [kortlepel.com](https://kortlepel.com).

This website is designed to be as "vanilla" as possible, and should load and work as fast as possible.

The frontend is being developed and maintained by **[@Efidar](https://github.com/efidar)**.
In the backend, there's a simple nginx instance.
